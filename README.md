# Data-For-Good-NYC-Specialized-High-School

## Goal

This project was part of PASSNYC: Data Science for Good Challenge to determine which schools need their services the most, hosted on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/passnyc/data-science-for-good).
The goal of this project is to quantify and analyze, which NYC public schools need more attention and and services to improve the chances of students taking the SHSAT and receiving placements in specialized highschools. 

## Background

- Specialized Highschools are NYC public high schools that requre an entrance exam (SHSAT). Depending on the grade, students are accepted into one or more of the 9 specialized high schools. 

- However, there is fewer students from underrepresented groups.

- Recently Mayor De Blasio has proposed [several changes](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/02/nyregion/de-blasio-new-york-schools.html) in the admission process that would "reflect the city better" and increase diversity.
